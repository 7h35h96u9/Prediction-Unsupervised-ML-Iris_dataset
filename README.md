This repository contains the task related to my internship with The Sparks Foundation

My Unsupervised ML program utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to analyze the Iris dataset and determine the optimum number of clusters. Here's a summary of the explanation:

1)The program first loads the Iris dataset using the load_iris() function from scikit-learn and creates a Pandas DataFrame to store the data.
2)The features in the dataset are standardized using the StandardScaler() from scikit-learn to ensure consistent scaling across different features.
3)The program then performs K-means clustering for different numbers of clusters, ranging from 1 to 10, and calculates the inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) for each clustering result. The inertia is a measure of how well the data points within each cluster are grouped together.
4)An "elbow curve" is plotted using Matplotlib to visualize the relationship between the number of clusters and the inertia. The elbow point on the curve represents a good trade-off between the compactness of clusters and the number of clusters, helping us determine the optimal number of clusters.
5)Once the optimal number of clusters is determined, the program performs K-means clustering again using the optimal number of clusters.
6)The cluster labels assigned to each data point are added as a new column, 'Cluster', to the Iris DataFrame.
7)Finally, the program plots the clusters on a scatter plot, with the x-axis representing the sepal length and the y-axis representing the sepal width. Each data point is colored based on its assigned cluster label, and grid lines are added to the plot for better visualization.

By running this program, you can gain insights into the structure of the Iris dataset and visually understand how the data points are grouped into different clusters based on the K-means clustering algorithm.

Unsupervised machine learning is a branch of machine learning where the algorithms learn patterns and structures in the data without explicit labels or target variables. Here's a summary of the use of unsupervised ML:

1)Exploratory Data Analysis: Unsupervised ML techniques can be used to explore and gain insights from raw data. They help in identifying patterns, correlations, and hidden structures in the absence of labeled data.
2)Clustering: Unsupervised ML algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering group similar data points together based on their inherent similarities. This helps in identifying natural clusters or segments within the data.
3)Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised ML can be used to detect anomalous or outlier data points that deviate significantly from the normal patterns in the data. This is particularly useful for fraud detection, network security, or identifying irregularities in datasets.
4)Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data while preserving important information. This aids in visualization, feature selection, and efficient processing of data.
5)Recommendation Systems: Unsupervised ML techniques are used to build recommendation systems by identifying similarities and patterns in user behavior or item features. These systems can provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
6)Data Preprocessing: Unsupervised ML algorithms can be employed to preprocess and transform data before applying supervised ML techniques. For example, feature scaling or normalization techniques are commonly used in unsupervised preprocessing steps.
